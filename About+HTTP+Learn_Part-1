Node.js is a javascript framwork. There are various in-built modules in node.js

Coming to [http] in node.js is a module that allows client-server communication via HTTP protocol.
-This module provides an interface to create either an HTTP client or HTTP server that can communicate with other HTTP servers or client.
-It also provides streaming of data using stream interface
  {Stream passes data in chunks, this shows that node.js never buffers the entire request
    or response at once in the memory}
   
  var http=require("http");
  var app=http.createserver((req,res) => {
                                          });
 *The "createserver" method returns a server object that we store in the variable "app". This server object is event emitter.
 
 Certain kinds of objects (called "emitter") can cause some function ("listeners") to be called by emitting any "named" events.
 
 {events in node.js -> emitter_cass.js}
 
- Listening to the request event
    app.on("request",(req,res) => {  //listen to all the "requests" events on our server object
                                  });
The "request" event provides the listener function with two parameter
a) req - an instance of http.incomingMessage object
b) res - an instance of http.serverResponce object

Incoming request have components liek URL,Method and Header.
Node.js makes it easy by attaching them as properties to the request object.

  const{headers,url,method} = request;
  
"request" object is a readable stream i.e. by listening to data and end
"response" object is a writable stream i.e. { setHeader(name,value);
                                              getHeader(name);
                                              removeHEader(name);
                                              }
                                              
                                              
  *****IMPLICITLY BY NODE.JS
   response.setHaader("Content-Type","application/json");
   var contentType=response.getHeader("content-type");
   response.removeHeader("content-Encoding");
   
   
  ******EXPLICITLY
   response.writeHead(200, {
                              "content-type":"application/json" //json
                              //OR
                              "content-type":"text/plain" //plain test
                              //OR
                              "content-type":"text/html" //html
                              //OR
                              "content-type":"text/xml" //xml
                            });
//to tell the client that we are sending such type of content.
